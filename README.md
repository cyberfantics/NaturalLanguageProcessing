## üóÇ Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **Labs**: Practical exercises and lab assignments for hands-on learning of NLP techniques and tools.
- **Lectures**: Lecture slides, notes, and explanations of the topics covered in the course.
- **Datasets**: Sample datasets used in labs and projects.
- **Projects**: End-of-course projects or advanced assignments integrating multiple NLP concepts.

## üîß Technologies and Tools Used
This course focuses on a wide range of NLP tools and libraries, including:

- **Python**: The primary language for all implementations.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For basic NLP operations like tokenization, stemming, and sentiment analysis.
- **SpaCy**: For efficient and advanced NLP pipelines.
- **TextBlob**: For simpler NLP tasks like part-of-speech tagging and text classification.
- **Pandas**: For handling and preprocessing datasets.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For building deep learning models for NLP tasks.

## üìö Topics Covered
The course includes a variety of foundational and advanced NLP topics:

- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- Language Models: N-grams, Markov chains, and modern transformer-based models (BERT, GPT).
- Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing emotions and opinions in text data.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying entities like names, dates, and locations in text.
- Text Classification: Using machine learning and deep learning for categorizing text.
- Machine Translation: Techniques and tools for translating text between languages.
- Question Answering and Chatbots: Developing interactive NLP applications.
- Advanced Topics: Transfer learning, fine-tuning, and generative models.
